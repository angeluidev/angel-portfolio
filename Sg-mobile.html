        <h3 class="project-sub">School Project - October 2019</h3>
        <h4>This is a school project requirement for the Visual Interface Design Module I took at Singapore Polytechnic. I have worked on this project individually. We were asked to identify existing websites that needed a user interface design refresh.</h4>

        <h4>As part of the requirement, I had to come up with a design proposal outlining the pain points in the existing website and the proposed solutions. I also created low and high fidelity wireframes using Sketch.</h4>

        <h4>This is SG Mobile - a website where customers can buy second-hand phones and mobile-owners can sell their used phones or trade-in for another model. Here's the <a href="http://www.sgmobile.sg/">original website:</a></h4>

        <h4><strong>The Problems:</strong></h4>

        <ol>
                <li>The website's information organization is weak. Most of the details are placed on the Home page.
                <li>The cart functionality is not working. Users can't shop or add products to cart.</li>
                <li>The lack of font spacing on the navigation makes it difficult to read the text.</li>
                <li>The color scheme of the website lacks harmony. The use of dark-colored font on a dark background makes the text challenging to read. It also made the look & feel of the site dubious.</li>
        </ol>
            

        <h4><strong>The Solution:</strong></h4>

        <ol>
            <li>For the redesign, the information was organised and properly categorized. This can be observed in the new navigation bar. This aims to reduce friction for users to figure out what they need to click on in order to carry out their desired action.
            </li>
            <li>Light-colored fonts are used on dark-colored backgrounds, and vice-versa, for improved readbility.</li>
            <li>Filters are also added so users can filter out unwanted information.</li>
        </ol>
